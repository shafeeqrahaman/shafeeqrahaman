Hello, I'm Shafeeq, a Data Analyst with comprehensive expertise in data management, encompassing data analysis, reporting, query optimization, database design, and data modeling.

Proficient in SQL, I specialize in querying data, generating reports, and performing ad-hoc data analysis. My proficiency extends to developing insightful dashboards using tools like Tableau and Looker Studio.

In addition to my skills in Google Sheets and Excel for data analysis and reporting, I harness the power of Google Apps Script to automate and customize processes within Google Sheets. Moreover, I utilize Google App Sheet to create user-friendly applications and streamline data management tasks.

To further enhance efficiency, I integrate funnel.io into my workflow, ensuring a smooth and optimized data flow throughout the analytical process. Additionally, my proficiency extends to Google BigQuery data warehousing, allowing me to handle large-scale data sets efficiently and derive meaningful insights. This comprehensive approach enables me to deliver actionable and valuable results from diverse data sources.
